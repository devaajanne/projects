## Personal projects

### Weather Twin
Weather twin is a silly little app that asks the user for a location input, then finds another location somewhere on the globe that has a similar weather than the user's location. The back-end has been written in Java with Spring Boot, and front-end has been written in JavaScript and React.

Back-end: [weathertwin-server](https://github.com/devaajanne/weathertwin-server)<br>
Front-end: [weathertwin-client](https://github.com/devaajanne/weathertwin-client)

## Study-related projects

### Runfinder
Runfinder is the final project for my [Back End Programming](https://opinto-opas.haaga-helia.fi/course_unit/SOF003AS3AE) course at Haaga-Helia. Runfinder features a web-service where users can log in and search for other people to go on a run with. Users can create run groups for other users to sign up. The project includes only the back-end which is written in Java with Spring Boot and Thymeleaf templates as well as a PostgreSQL database.

Back-end: [runfinder-app](https://github.com/devaajanne/runfinder-app)

### Personal trainer
Personal trainer is the final project for my [Front End Programming](https://opinto-opas.haaga-helia.fi/course_unit/SOF004AS3AE) course at Haaga-Helia. It features a front-end for a personal trainer. Features include client and training management, calendar view and statistics. The project includes only the front-end (as back-end was provided) and it is written in JavaScript and React. REST API is used to connect the front-end to the back-end.

### TickerGuru
TicketGuru is the course project for my [Software development project 1](https://opinto-opas.haaga-helia.fi/course_unit/SOF005AS3AE) course at Haaga-Helia. The project includes a ticket management app for a ticket sales company, with features to add, remove and modify event venues, events and ticket types, to view sold tickets, to track the amount of sold tickets to each event and the possibility to sell tickets to events.

This project was done in a group of five students. As technologies, we used Java with Spring Boot in the back-end, JavaScript with React and TailwindCSS on the front end and PostgreSQL as the database. The project also features REST API endpoints and calls for data transfer.

### Kämppis
Kämppis is the course project for my [Software Development Project 2](https://opinto-opas.haaga-helia.fi/course_unit/SOF007AS3AE) course at Haaga-Helia. In this project, we design and create a mobile app for people to find roommates to live with.

This project is done in a group of five students. As technologies, we use Kotlin with Spring Boot on the back end and React Native on the front-end. PostgreSQL is our database solution. Each of us students have a specific responsibility area in the project; I am in charge of scrum and general project management and admin-work outside programming itself.
